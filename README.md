# 🧩 AgencyCRM – Client Management Dashboard UI

AgencyCRM is a **web-based CRM (Client Relationship Management) Dashboard UI** designed for **small agencies and B2B service-based businesses**.  
This project was created as part of **UI/UX Internship – Task 3** and focuses on designing a **realistic SaaS dashboard experience** that supports lead management, client tracking, sales pipelines, and task follow-ups.

---

## 📖 Background & Context

In many small agencies and B2B teams, client data, sales progress, and follow-up tasks are often scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and multiple tools.  
This leads to:
- Missed follow-ups  
- Poor visibility into deal status  
- Inefficient daily workflows  

AgencyCRM aims to solve these problems by providing a **centralized dashboard UI** where teams can monitor business activity, track client engagement, and manage work efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to design a **clean, structured, and usable CRM dashboard UI** that:

- Presents critical business data clearly  
- Supports workflow-based navigation  
- Enables quick decision-making  
- Reflects real-world agency and B2B use cases  

The focus was on **usability and clarity**, rather than purely visual aesthetics.

---

## 🧠 Design Scope

This project covers the **core functionality of a CRM system**, including:

- Lead tracking  
- Client management  
- Sales pipeline visualization  
- Task and follow-up management  

The design is **desktop-first**, as CRM dashboards are primarily used in professional work environments.

---

## 🧩 Information Architecture

The dashboard is structured into four primary sections:

1. **Dashboard**
2. **Leads & Clients**
3. **Pipeline**
4. **Tasks**

Each section represents a key part of the CRM workflow and is accessible through a persistent top navigation.

**Pipeline stages include:**
- New Lead  
- Contacted  
- Proposal Sent  
- Negotiation

Each stage displays:
- Number of leads
